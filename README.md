### Raffaele Lomartire

#### About
I'm an MSc student in the [Mathematical Physics group](https://mathphys.univie.ac.at/) at University of Vienna under the supervision of Stefan Fredenhagen.

My Master's thesis topic deals with a higher-spin generalization of the reduction of asymptotically AdS3 general relativity to Liouville conformal field theory on the outer boundary.
